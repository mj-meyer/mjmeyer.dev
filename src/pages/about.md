---

I'm a frontend engineer with more than 14 years of hands-on experience, eight of which I've spent deeply engaged in SaaS application development. I love leading from the trenches, combining technical and servant leadership, while staying hands-on with coding and delivering the final products.

Writing clean, testable code is always the goal, while keeping in mind that everything has trade-offs and technical debt is inevitable. I strive to manage and mitigate any impact from accrued debt effectively.

I'm actively expanding my fullstack skills, focusing on system architecture, backend and DevOps processes along with their related technologies.

## My strengths

- My self-awareness enables me to discern when I can contribute and when I need to solicit help.
- I strive to foster a positive team environment by recognizing and promoting the excellent work done by my colleagues.
- With a natural inclination for problem-solving, I tackle both technical and personal challenges with equal fervour.
- My passion for staying updated with the latest tech excites me more than the latest Netflix drop. I find immense joy in my work!
- I set high standards for myself, focusing on personal growth and excellence rather than imposing expectations on others.
- I embrace change, even when it invokes fear, as I believe the most significant growth and purpose often reside in overcoming challenging or daunting circumstances.
