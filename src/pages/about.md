<details><summary>The intro blurb on the home page if you haven't read it...</summary>

> In a galaxy plagued by bad software, bugs, atrocious UX, and legacy UI, I've dedicated the last 14 years to crafting stellar digital experiences using HTML, CSS, and a variety of JS/TS frameworks & libraries, including Angular, Next, Remix, Astro, and Node.js.

> As a Star Wars-loving, Xbox-jamming, BBQ (braai) aficionado, my mission goes beyond vanquishing the digital dark side. I'm all about having fun, being a devoted husband to my incredible wife, and guiding my two foundlings in "the way" as we navigate our new home (SAðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ âžž NZðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿).
