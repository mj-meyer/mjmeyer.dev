The obligatory hello world! What would a developer's corner on the internet be without a greeting to the world?

This note also serves as a credits section, attributing the technologies used on this website. It will be updated regularly, as this is a [digital garden](./what-is-a-digital-garden).

Updated timestamps and links to individual notes may be added in future to track the garden's evolution.

## Astro

I chose [Astro](https://astro.build/) for several reasons:

- It's new. Shiny object syndrome? ðŸ˜‚
- Easy setup and excellent DX.
- No need to worry about performance or excess JS in the browser.
- Ideal for a markdown-powered digital garden.
- It's BLAZINGLY FAST by default.

I'm sure there are a few other reasons too. Ultimately though, I've been looking at a solution to help me put together a plan for what I've been wanting to build for quite some time.

More on "the plan" in future, but essentially, I needed something that I knew would work well for any developer of any skill level. This is where I think Astro shines!

It's simple enough to get up and running, yet capable enough to do interesting things with.

## AstroPaper Theme

I'm using the [AstroPaper](https://astro.build/themes/details/astro-paper/) theme, which I initially planned to use without modifications. However, I ended up customizing it due to Astro's ease of use.

I found some quirks in the theme and will likely submit a PR soon. Regardless, I highly recommend it as a starter theme.

## Vercel

My domain and previous blog, which never really took off, were already set up on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). They have great Astro support, so I'll continue hosting with them.

## Convertkit

I've set up [ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com/) for managing my upcoming newsletter.
