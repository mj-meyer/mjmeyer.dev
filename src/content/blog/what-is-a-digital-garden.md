## Gardening, not blogging

Digital gardening is a creative approach to content creation and organization that emphasizes the evolving nature of ideas, rather than presenting them as polished final products.

Inspired by the metaphor of a garden, this concept encourages personal, ongoing development of thoughts and ideas, nurtured over time like plants in a garden.

By focusing on curation and organic connections between content pieces, digital gardens break away from the traditional chronological structure of blogs and embrace a more exploratory and dynamic experience for both the creator and the audience.

## The history of digital gardening

The first time I heard of digital gardening was from a post by Joel Hooks, [My blog is a digital garden, not a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden).

Not long after, Maggie Appleton's post, [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), popped up on my radar.

Maggie does an EXCELLENT job going through the the history of what a digital garden is.

I'll summarize this section a bit better in future. For now, you'll have to do it the old school way and click those links ðŸ˜‰.

## The freedom of a garden

In a garden, you have the freedom to experiment, explore, and let your creativity run wild. It's not about perfection; it's about cultivating a space that nurtures growth and evolution. A digital garden embraces this same philosophy, allowing you to express your thoughts and ideas without the pressure of having everything polished or finished.

Your digital garden is a flexible, adaptable space that reflects your unique interests and intellectual journey. As you learn and grow, so does your garden, and there's no need for rigid structures or predetermined outcomes. This organic, fluid approach to content creation encourages continuous learning and reflection, making your garden a true reflection of your evolving thoughts and passions.

In this liberating environment, perfectionism is replaced with curiosity, and the fear of failure is transformed into a willingness to experiment and learn. By cultivating your digital garden, you are not only expanding your own horizons but also inviting others to engage with your ideas, fostering a sense of community and shared exploration.

Embrace the freedom of a garden and discover the joy of nurturing your own unique, ever-evolving digital landscape.

## Future iterations

I'm not completely happy with my summarisation of digital gardening. Any feedback or questions you have will help me, so please get in contact.
