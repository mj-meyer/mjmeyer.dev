It's probably one of the most common pages and in some cases, the only page on a developer's blog.

And to be honest, it was one of two pages on this very site for quite some time.

One of the main causes of friction has always been between my [note making](/unpublished) system, which is powered by [Obsidian](/unpublished), and getting a selected set of those notes published.

Well, recently I worked on removing that friction.

## Going forward

This note (and all other notes) officially lives in my [digital garden](/unpublished). Powered by [Obsidian](/unpublished). 

Based on some frontmatter tags, it'll now be as simple as running a command to process all my notes using my custom built [notes processor](/unpublished).

I plan on automating it even further using GitHub actions, but for now, it's massively decreased the friction of publishing notes.

It's not a perfect system, but it's mine. And it's easy to customise the way I want.

Consider this note a test to see if my little gardening experiment pays off.
