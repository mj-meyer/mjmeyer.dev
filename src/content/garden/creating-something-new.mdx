Every big idea starts with a simple question: **_What if?_** 

That spark of curiosity can lead to projects that solve real problems, build communities, or even change your life. Along the way, I’ve found that creating something new is about much more than just coding—it’s about exploration, resilience, and growth.

## Exploration
It’s the phase where anything feels possible—and where the biggest lessons about starting often live.

## Resilience
Building something isn’t easy. Resilience is about pushing through when things get tough—whether it’s debugging, iterating, or staying motivated through setbacks. This is where projects succeed or stall, depending on how you approach the obstacles.

## Growth
Growth is what happens when you embrace the journey. It’s about learning from mistakes, celebrating small wins, and seeing how far you’ve come. For me, it’s as much about personal growth as it is about scaling a project.
