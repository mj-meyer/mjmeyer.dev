# Test note for Garden Three

This is a test for the garden note which is going to be a seedling. Just trying to test out and see how this looks.

oh this is a big note which links to [which should not exist Upper case and 5 with ! in here](/unpublished)

but it will also link to something legit like [test stream note for an article](test-stream-note-for-an-article)
