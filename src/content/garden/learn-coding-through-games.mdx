Although I prefer learning through building projects, playing fun interactive games while learning a new concept definitely helps. Everyone learns differently, and if you're just starting out, this might just be what you need to grok some new concepts.
## CSS
- [CSSBattle](https://cssbattle.dev/)
	- You use CSS to recreate a target image in the least amount of code. Having the added constraint of trying to write the least amount of code is definitely something that'll help you learn some advanced selector targeting and keeping your HTML clean.
- [Flexbox Zombies](https://flexboxzombies.com/p/flexbox-zombies)
	- Battle zombies while mastering Flexbox! Each level teaches a new layout concept to help you escape the undead.
- [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/)
	- Grow a virtual carrot garden by writing CSS Grid code. A playful way to grasp advanced layout techniques.

## SQL
- [SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/)
	- Use SQL queries to solve a murder mystery. An engaging way to learn database concepts while investigating a crime scene.

## Crypto
