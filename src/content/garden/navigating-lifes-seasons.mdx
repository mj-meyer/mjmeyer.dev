Recognising shifts in your life's seasons isn’t just about going with the flow. It’s about understanding where you are, so you can navigate with intention and experience [The joy of agency—being in control of where you're going](/unpublished)

These are my reflections and notes on how to stand steadfast, move forward and thrive no matter what life throws at you.

## Balance
Navigating competing priorities, finding stability, and managing life's ebbs and flows.
### The People Who Ground You

Seasons with family can be some of the most joyful and complex. It’s not always easy to pause work or a passion project, but the people closest to us often shape the meaning of our lives. When things feel out of balance, remember to pause, prioritise, and reconnect.

### Anchors in Uncertainty

When life feels like it's crushing you under stress, faith—or whatever grounding principles you hold—acts as a fallback mechanism. It’s the thing that catches you when everything else seems unpredictable.

## Purpose
Understanding what drives you, aligning efforts with values, and pursuing meaningful goals.
### What Drives You?

Purpose evolves, just like your skillset as a developer. Early on, you might focus on gaining knowledge, but over time, your purpose might shift toward mentoring others or creating something lasting.

### Energy for the Journey

We don’t talk enough about how physical and mental health affects everything. Just like a well-written application depends on solid infrastructure, our health is the foundation for navigating all other seasons.

## Change
Embracing transitions, learning from disruptions, and adapting to life’s transformations.
### Seasons of Hustle and Rest
Not every season is about growth. Some are about maintenance or even stepping back. I’ve learned this the hard way—burning out because I thought progress always had to be forward.

### The Beauty of Change
Change can feel like breaking changes in code—disruptive and, at times, frustrating. But those changes often lead to better systems. Life’s seasons are no different. When you embrace transitions, you realise they’re not the end but the beginning of something new.
