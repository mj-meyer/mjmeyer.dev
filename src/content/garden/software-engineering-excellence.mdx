Thereâ€™s so much to learn in software engineering, but not all of it will be useful on your journey. Take my learnings, thoughts, and notes with a grain of salt

I have my own [goals I'm chasing](chasing-big-goals), and while excellence can be subjective, I believe there are principles, patterns, and ways of working that are more [directionally correct](/unpublished) than others.

These notes might not always apply to your circumstances, but I hope they offer valueâ€”whether by revealing options, showcasing whatâ€™s worked before, or helping avoid the mistakes of the past. Letâ€™s explore and learn together ðŸ‘‡

> [!note]+ Work in progress
> This page is evolving as I continue exploring these topics. Some sections are drafts; others are ideas waiting to be fleshed out. Dive in and join me in the journey.
