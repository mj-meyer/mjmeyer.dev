# Test for Stream with a code example

This is a test for the stream note. I'm not sure which one I should pick. Maybe it should be a video one or it could be a Twitter one.

```typescript {3, 8-10} copy showLineNumbers filename="test.ts"
type MyTest = {
	propone: string
	proptwo: string[]
}

const message = "hello there"

function(param: MyTest){
	return `I just want to say ${message}`
}
```

It doesn't really matter because the media won't be contained in here. It's just an example.

## Here's a second heading

With some random text, who know's what's possible at the moment. We'll have to see how all this renders.

But it's anyone's guess. I'll get it working though.

### Just want to grab a 3rd heading here too

I already know what it would look like, but yeah, just for shits and giggles, let's do this.
