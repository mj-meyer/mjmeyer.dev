# Test stream note for an article

This is a test for the stream note. I'm not sure which one I should pick. Maybe it should be a video one or it could be a Twitter one.

Should maybe consider using that obsidian plugin, for cards. But that uses code blocks with frontmatter like syntax. Not sure if I want that in my markdown.

But tbh, I can always let my processor fix whatever I do in my notes if it becomes an issue.

That link should be turned into a nice card to show what I'm talking about. We should probably keep things minimal without any other links on this page.
