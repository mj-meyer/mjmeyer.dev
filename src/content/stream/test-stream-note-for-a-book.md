description: Really cool stream note that's for a link to a book. Not sure if I thought this through, cause a book note would be extensive. Maybe this is just a quote or highlight or something?

# Test stream note for a book

That reminds me, I'd like to test those callout thingy for obsidian.

It doesn't really matter because the media won't be contained in here. It's just an example.
