# Stream note four for video

This is a test for the stream note. I'm not sure which one I should pick. Maybe it should be a video one or it could be a Twitter one.

It doesn't really matter because the media won't be contained in here. It's just an example.

[Test Note for Garden](test-note-for-garden) and then ofcourse there's this note which will have an alias [now page](/unpublished).
